# Oculus Quest Sample Project
A simple android studio project with the Oculus Native SDK installed and the minimun posible aplication.<br/>
The source code what taking from makepad's hello_quest respository (https://github.com/makepad/hello_quest), that is a non-Android Studio dependant, simple version, of one of the native samples provided by oculus.<br/>
But since that also removes the capability of debugging, so I merged atyomd and makepad's projects into a simple package to start toying with the SDK.
